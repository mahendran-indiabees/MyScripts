### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process for Java microservices in GitLab. It aims to improve the efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of the existing workflow, making it easier to manage and deploy microservices across various environments.

### 2. Existing CI/CD Workflow Design

The current CI/CD workflow design in GitLab involves multiple branches for each environment. The development team manages separate branches corresponding to different environments (e.g., dev, SIT, UAT, prod), each with its deployment scripts and configurations. The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is used to define all CI/CD processes, including build, test, and deployment stages for each environment.

### 3. Existing CI/CD Workflow Process

1. **Branching for Each Environment**: The development team uses a separate branch for each environment:
   - `dev` branch for the development environment.
   - `SIT` branch for the SIT environment.
   - `UAT` branch for the UAT environment.
   - `master` branch for the production environment.

2. **Monolithic CI/CD Script**: All CI/CD scripts are defined within a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This script includes multiple blocks of code that are repeated across different environments, leading to redundancy.

3. **Redundant Deployment Scripts**: The deployment process is defined separately for each environment within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, even though the deployment steps are identical across environments. This repetition increases the complexity and maintenance overhead.

### 4. Proposed CI/CD Workflow Design

The proposed CI/CD workflow design aims to standardize the branching strategy and streamline the deployment process. The new design introduces a more modular approach, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability. The workflow will focus on three main branches: `feature`, `release`, and `master`.

### 5. Proposed CI/CD Process

1. **Standardized Branching Strategy**:
   - Use a `feature` branch for ongoing development work.
   - Use a `release` branch for staging and pre-production environments (SIT, UAT).
   - Use the `master` branch for production deployment.

2. **Automated Deployment to Development Environment**:
   - Any changes made in a `feature` branch will be automatically deployed to the `dev` environment. This allows for continuous testing and integration in the development environment.

3. **Merge Request to Release Branch**:
   - Once changes are tested and validated in the `dev` environment, the developer will raise a merge request (MR) to merge the `feature` branch into the `release` branch.

4. **Manual Deployment to Higher Environments**:
   - Changes in the `release` branch will be manually deployed to higher environments (SIT, UAT). The deployment jobs in GitLab for these environments will be manual and triggered based on user confirmation.

5. **Merge to Master and Production Deployment**:
   - After testing in the higher environments (SIT, UAT), the user will raise an MR to merge the `release` branch into the `master` branch. Once merged, the changes will be automatically deployed to the production environment.

### 6. Benefits

- **Reduced Redundancy**: By eliminating repetitive deployment scripts and adopting a modular approach, the CI/CD process becomes more maintainable.
- **Improved Efficiency**: The automated deployment to the `dev` environment streamlines the development process, allowing for quicker feedback and testing.
- **Standardized Process**: The standardized branching strategy ensures consistency across all microservices and environments, reducing the risk of errors and simplifying the workflow.
- **Controlled Deployments**: Manual deployment to higher environments provides more control and ensures that only tested and validated changes reach production.

### 7. Existing Process Summary

- The development team uses multiple branches for different environments (dev, SIT, UAT, prod).
- All CI/CD scripts are consolidated in a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- Deployment scripts are duplicated across the file, leading to redundancy and higher maintenance effort.

### 8. Proposed CI/CD Process Summary

- Adoption of a standardized branching strategy (feature, release, master).
- Automatic deployment of `feature` branch changes to the `dev` environment.
- Manual deployment of `release` branch changes to higher environments (SIT, UAT).
- Automatic deployment of `master` branch changes to the production environment following a successful merge.

This proposed CI/CD process will provide a more streamlined, efficient, and maintainable approach to managing the deployment of Java microservices in GitLab.
