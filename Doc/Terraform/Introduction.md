## What is Terraform
* Terraform is a infrastructure-as-code (IAC) tool that allows you to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources.
  
* Terraform allows you to describe your complete infrastructure in the form of code. It allows programmers to build, change and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.
  
* It uses configuration files written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define the desired state of your infrastructure
  
## Benefits
**Automation:** Terraform automates the setup and management of your infrastructure, saving time and reducing human errors.

**Version Control:** Infrastructure configurations can be stored in version control systems (like Git), making it easy to track changes and collaborate with others.

**Reproducibility:** Easily recreate environments by applying the same configuration files, which is useful for testing, development, and production environments.

**Cost Efficiency:** Automating infrastructure deployment and management helps reduce operational costs and optimize resource usage.


## Stages of Terraform
* Write the configuration file
  
* Review the plan
  
* Apply the plan
