#### What is Docker Volume?
Docker volumes are a widely used and useful tool for ensuring data persistence while working in containers. Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container.

In Docker, you can write data on the writable layer. But the data doesn’t persist after a container shuts down. Also, it’s not easy to move the data from one container to another.

Docker has three types of data mounts that can help – **volumes, bind mounts, and tmpfs.**
* **Volumes** store data in the host’s filesystem but it is managed by Docker.
* **Bind mounts** help store data anywhere on the host system and users can directly modify the files from the host’s own processes.
* **tmpfs mounts** are stored in the host’s memory only.
#### How to create docker volume
```
docker volume create <VolumeName>
docker volume create my-common-vol
```

**Note**: 
* If you don't specify volume name, Docker will create volume with random name (Unique id - E.g 77488409474662554320047u474)
* In default, Volume is created with default driver called local. If you want to use specific driver, we can mention driver name while we create volume.

#### How to Mount volume
```
docker run -it --name=ContainerName --mount source=<Volume Name>,destination=<Container Mount Path> ImageName
docker run -it --name=webserver --mount source=appdatastore,destination=/var/www/html httpd
```
#### How to Mount data volume
```
docker run -it --name=ContainerName --mount source=<Volume Name>,destination=<Container Mount Path> ImageName
docker run -it --name=webserver --mount source=appdatastore,destination=/var/www/html httpd
```

#### How to Mount Bind volume or host file system into docker container
```
docker run --name=ContainerName -v [Source Path in Host file system]:[Destination Path in Container] [docker_image]
docker run --name=webserver -v /app/var/data:/var/www/html html
```
#### Remove specific volume
```
docker volume rm [volume Name]
```
#### Remove unused volumes
```
docker volume prune
```

**Ovelay2**
* Ovelay2 is the preferred storage driver for all currently supported Linux distributions, and requires no extra configuration. This is a stable driver and it is in line with the main Linux kernel functionality.
* It has a good memory usage.
* This driver is good for testing applications in the lab.

**AUFS**
* This is a stable driver; can be used for production-ready applications.
* It has good memory usage and is good for ensuring a smooth Docker experience for containers.
* There is a high-write activity associated with this driver which should be considered.
* It’s good for systems which are of Platform as a service type work.

**Devicemapper**
* This is a stable driver; ensures a smooth Docker experience.
* This driver is good for testing applications in the lab.
* This driver is in line with the main Linux kernel functionality.

**ZFS**
* This is a stable driver and it is good for testing applications in the lab.
* It’s good for systems which are of Platform-as-a-Service type work.
