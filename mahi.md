**Existing CI/CD Workflow Overview for Application:**

1. **Feature Branch Development:**
   - Developers create a **feature branch** from the **master** branch to begin their development.
   - All development work is conducted within this feature branch.

2. **Manual Pipeline Trigger:**
   - Once the development work is completed, the development team **manually triggers the GitLab pipeline**.
   
3. **Environment-specific Builds and Deployments:**
   - For each environment (**DEV**, **SIT**, **UAT**), the development team **builds the JAR file** from the feature branch source code and **deploys** it to the respective environment.
   
4. **Merging to Production:**
   - After successful testing in the higher environments, the developer merges the **feature branch into the production branch**.
   
5. **Production Build and Deployment:**
   - The developer again **builds the JAR file** in the production branch and deploys it to **PROD**.

### **Limitations of the Existing Workflow:**

1. **Single Feature Branch Handling:**
   - The current workflow uses a single feature branch for development, builds, and deployments across all environments (DEV, SIT, UAT). This makes it **challenging to revert specific changes** if an issue is identified, as all features are merged and handled in the same branch.

2. **Manual Pipeline Triggers:**
   - The **manual triggering** of the GitLab pipeline introduces the possibility of human error and reduces the efficiency of the CI/CD process. It may also delay the deployment process.

3. **Environment-Specific Builds:**
   - The team builds the JAR file **separately for each environment** (DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD). This could lead to **inconsistencies** in the builds across environments, especially if there are unintentional differences in the build configuration. Ideally, the same build artifact should be promoted across all environments to ensure consistency.

4. **No Continuous Integration/Testing:**
   - There appears to be a lack of **continuous integration** and **automated testing** in the workflow. Without automated testing and integration, bugs may not be detected early, leading to more issues during higher-environment deployments.

5. **Rollback Challenges:**
   - Given that the same feature branch is used for development and deployment, rolling back changes is complex. There is no streamlined process for **versioning** and rolling back to a previous state if issues arise in higher environments or production.

6. **Inconsistent Artifact Versioning:**
   - The absence of **version management** for build artifacts across environments means there is no tracking or rollback mechanism for specific builds. Every environment rebuilds from source instead of promoting a tested and approved artifact.

7. **Production-Specific Build Process:**
   - Rebuilding the JAR in the production branch increases the risk of producing a different artifact from the one that was tested in DEV, SIT, or UAT, potentially introducing new issues during the final deployment to production.

### **Additional Limitations and Areas for Improvement:**

- **Lack of Environment Promotion:** Implementing a **build-once-deploy-everywhere** approach would mitigate inconsistencies by promoting the same build artifact (JAR) across environments, rather than rebuilding it for each.
  
- **Automated Testing:** Adding automated testing (unit, integration, and regression) into the pipeline before merging to higher environments would catch bugs earlier, improving the reliability of deployments.

- **Rollback Mechanism:** Introduce a proper version control and rollback mechanism for the JAR file across environments, ensuring the ability to revert to a stable version if issues are detected post-deployment.

- **Environment Configuration:** Ensure that environment-specific configurations (e.g., environment variables, secrets) are separated from the source code and managed properly through the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., via Helm, ConfigMaps, or environment variables).

This documentation highlights both the current workflow and the potential areas that need improvement for more efficient, reliable, and automated CI/CD processes.
